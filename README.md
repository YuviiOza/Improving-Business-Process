# Improving-Business-Process
This project visualizes the order fulfillment process for a business, illustrating both the current "as-is" state and the future "to-be" state. It employs Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) to define workflows, identify gaps, and support senior management in conducting a gap analysis for process improvement.
