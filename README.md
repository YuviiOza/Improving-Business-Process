# Improving-Business-Process
This project visualizes the order fulfillment process for a business, illustrating both the current "as-is" state and the future "to-be" state. It employs Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) to define workflows, identify gaps, and support senior management in conducting a gap analysis for process improvement.
# Order Fulfillment Process Visualization

This repository contains a detailed visualization of a business's order fulfillment process, showcasing the current ("as-is") and optimized ("to-be") states. It uses Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) to support gap analysis and process improvement initiatives.

## **Project Objectives**

- Visualize the **current order fulfillment process** ("as-is") to identify inefficiencies.
- Design the **future optimized process** ("to-be") to improve performance and align with business goals.
- Enable senior management to conduct a gap analysis and plan for enhancements.

## **Key Definitions**

- **Business Activity**: The "what" of the business, categorized as Planning, Enabling, Doing, Monitoring, and Control activities.
- **Business Activity Model**: A conceptual model illustrating dependencies and aligning stakeholders.
- **Business Process**: The "how" of the business, comprising Inputs, Outputs, Events, Tasks, and Decisions.
- **BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation)**: A standardized approach to process modeling using flowchart symbols.
- **As-Is Process State**: The current process state representing existing workflows.
- **To-Be Process State**: The optimized future process state.

## **Project Components**

1. **As-Is Process State**:
   - A detailed BPMN diagram showcasing the current workflows, tasks, and decision points.

2. **To-Be Process State**:
   - An optimized BPMN diagram proposing improvements and streamlined processes for efficiency.

3. **Gap Analysis**:
   - A comparative analysis of the "as-is" and "to-be" states to identify key inefficiencies and areas of improvement.
